## Question s1q22

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
Let's solve this step by step:

1) ABCD is a square, so:
   - All sides are equal
   - All angles are 90°
   - Diagonals AC and BD are equal and bisect each other

2) Given that AB = EB:
   - This means E is equidistant from A and B
   - Therefore, E lies on the perpendicular bisector of AB

3) Given that ∠BAE = 65°:
   - In a square, diagonal AC bisects angle BAD
   - ∠BAC = 45° (half of 90°)
   - Since ∠BAE = 65°, ∠EAC = 45° - 25° = 20°

4) Due to the properties of a square:
   - ∠BCE = ∠EAC = 20°
   - Because AC is a diagonal that divides the square into two equal triangles

Therefore, ∠BCE = 20°

## Question s1q27

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
Let's solve this step by step:

1) Let's say Jenny's initial savings is x
2) Then Harry's initial savings would be 5x/4 (from ratio 5:4)
3) After spending $50 each:
   - Jenny's savings becomes (x - 50)
   - Harry's savings becomes (5x/4 - 50)
4) The new ratio is 13:10, so:
   (5x/4 - 50)/(x - 50) = 13/10

5) Cross multiply:
   10(5x/4 - 50) = 13(x - 50)
   50x/4 - 500 = 13x - 650
   50x - 2000 = 52x - 2600
   -2x = -600
   x = 300

Therefore, Jenny's initial savings was $300.

## Question s1q28

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
Let's solve this step by step:

1) Let's say there are x women in the queue
2) This means there are (115 - x) men in the queue
3) If there are at least 3 men between any 2 women, then between any 2 consecutive women in line, there must be at least 3 men
4) For x women, there are (x-1) gaps between them
5) Each gap must have at least 3 men
6) So: (x-1) × 3 ≤ total number of men
7) (x-1) × 3 ≤ (115 - x)
8) 3x - 3 ≤ 115 - x
9) 3x - 3 + x ≤ 115
10) 4x - 3 ≤ 115
11) 4x ≤ 118
12) x ≤ 29.5

Since x must be a whole number, and we want the largest possible number of women, x = 29.

## Question s1q29

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
Let's solve this step by step:

1) Let's say each box had x pencils at first
2) Initially, total pencils = 5x (5 boxes with x pencils each)
3) After taking 21 pencils from each box:
   * Each box now has (x - 21) pencils
   * Total pencils left = 5(x - 21)
4) This remaining amount equals the initial amount in 2 boxes:
   * 5(x - 21) = 2x
5) Solve the equation:
   * 5x - 105 = 2x
   * 3x = 105
   * x = 35

Therefore, each box initially contained 35 pencils.

To verify:
- Initially: 5 boxes × 35 pencils = 175 pencils total
- After removing 21 from each: 5 boxes × (35-21) = 5 × 14 = 70 pencils left
- Initial amount in 2 boxes: 2 × 35 = 70 pencils
The numbers check out.

**Answer:** 35

## Question s2q03

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
Let's solve this step by step:

1) In a rhombus:
   - All sides are equal in length
   - Opposite angles are equal
   - The sum of all interior angles is 360°

2) Given that ∠BAC = 52°, and due to the properties of a rhombus:
   - The opposite angle ∠BCD is also 52°

3) In a rhombus, adjacent angles are supplementary, meaning they sum to 180°
   - If ∠BAC = 52°, then ∠ABC = 180° - 52° = 128°
   - Similarly, ∠CDA = 128° (opposite to ∠ABC)

4) Looking at angles x and y in the diagram:
   - y = ∠ABC = 128°
   - x = ∠BCD = 52°

5) Therefore, x + y = 52° + 128° = 180°

**Answer:** 180

Let me solve this step by step:

a) Looking at the pie chart, Dance Club and Brownies together make up the section between Track and Field and Soccer. Since we know Soccer is 30% and Scouts is 15%, and the total must be 100%, we can calculate:
100% - 30% - 15% - 25%(Track and Field) = 30% for Dance Club and Brownies combined

b) Given that Dance Club : Brownies = 3 : 2
Let's solve:
- Total percentage for both = 30%
- Let's divide 30% into 5 parts (3 parts for Dance Club, 2 parts for Brownies)
- Each part = 30% ÷ 5 = 6%
- Brownies = 2 parts = 2 × 6% = 12%
- Therefore, number of students in Brownies = 12% of 300 = 36 students

**Answer:** ['30%', '36 students']

**Correct:** Yes (+1, +2)

## Question s2q07

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
Let me solve this step by step:

1) First, I need to find the total volume of the container:
   * Left section: 42 cm × 24 cm × 85 cm = 85,680 cm³
   * Right section: 14 cm × 24 cm × 20 cm = 6,720 cm³
   * Total volume = 85,680 + 6,720 = 92,400 cm³

2) Convert cubic centimeters to liters:
   * 1 liter = 1000 cm³
   * 92,400 cm³ = 92.4 liters

3) Given the flow rate of 2.01 liters per minute:
   * Time = Volume ÷ Flow rate
   * Time = 92.4 ÷ 2.01 = 46 minutes

Therefore, it will take 46 minutes to fill the container completely.

**Answer:** 46 minutes

**Correct:** No

## Question s2q08

**Question Type:** open_ended_with_multiple_parts

**Reasoning:**
Let me solve this step by step:

1) For finding the meeting time:
- Total distance = 1680 km
- Train X speed = 230 km/h
- Train Y speed = 190 km/h
- Combined speed = 230 + 190 = 420 km/h
- Time = Distance ÷ Combined speed
- Time = 1680 ÷ 420 = 4 hours
- Starting time = 8:00 AM
- Meeting time = 8:00 AM + 4 hours = 12:00 PM (noon)

2) For finding distance traveled by each train:
- Time taken = 4 hours
- Train X distance = Speed × Time = 230 × 4 = 920 km
- Train Y distance = Speed × Time = 190 × 4 = 760 km
(Note: 920 + 760 = 1680 km, which confirms our calculation)

**Answer:** ['12:00 PM', 'Train X: 920 km, Train Y: 760 km']

**Correct:** Yes (+1, +2)

## Question s2q09

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
Let's solve this step by step:

1) Initially:
   - Soccer balls: 45
   - Basketballs: 30
   - Netballs: 68
   Total: 143 balls

2) After adding 80 balls:
   - Soccer balls increased by 40%: 45 × 1.4 = 63 balls (increase of 18 balls)
   - Netballs increased by 25%: 68 × 1.25 = 85 balls (increase of 17 balls)
   - Total increase in soccer and netballs = 18 + 17 = 35 balls

3) Out of 80 new balls:
   - 35 balls went to soccer and netballs
   - Therefore, 80 - 35 = 45 balls went to basketballs
   - New number of basketballs = 30 + 45 = 75 balls

4) Percentage increase in basketballs:
   - Increase = 45 balls
   - Original amount = 30 balls
   - Percentage increase = (45 ÷ 30) × 100 = 150%

**Answer:** 150

**Correct:** Yes (+3)

## Question s2q10

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's find out how long it took Tammy to reach the park:
   * Distance = 20 km
   * Speed = 30 km/h
   * Time = Distance/Speed = 20/30 = 2/3 hour = 40 minutes

2) We know Adam arrived 15 minutes later than Tammy
   * So Adam's travel time = Tammy's time + 15 minutes
   * Adam's travel time = 40 + 15 = 55 minutes = 55/60 = 11/12 hour

3) Now we can find Adam's distance using:
   * Distance = Speed × Time
   * Distance = 42 km/h × 11/12 hour
   * Distance = 42 × 11/12 = 38.5 km

Therefore, the distance between Adam's home and the park is 38.5 kilometers.

**Answer:** 38.5 kilometers

**Correct:** Yes (+3)

## Question s2q11

**Question Type:** open_ended_with_multiple_parts

**Reasoning:**
Let's solve this step by step:

(a) For ∠BCD:
- Given that DF is a straight line, angles on a straight line sum to 180°
- We know ∠ADF = 42°
- Therefore, ∠BCD = 180° - 42° = 138°

(b) For ∠ABE:
- In parallelogram ABEF, opposite angles are equal
- Corresponding angles formed by parallel lines are equal
- ∠DAF = 68° (given)
- Therefore, ∠ABE = 68° (corresponding angles, as AB ∥ FD)

(c) For ∠BEF:
- In parallelogram ABEF, opposite angles are equal
- ∠BEF = ∠BAF
- ∠BAF = 180° - 68° = 112° (angles in a triangle sum to 180°)
- Therefore, ∠BEF = 112°

**Answer:** ['138°', '68°', '112°']

**Correct:** No

## Question s2q12

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
Let's solve this step by step:

1) Let's say initially there were x boys and y girls
   * x + y = 2120 (total students)

2) After 536 boys and 1/4 of girls left:
   * New number of boys = x - 536
   * New number of girls = y - (1/4)y = (3/4)y
   * Ratio of boys to girls is 4:9
   * (x - 536)/(3y/4) = 4/9

3) From the ratio equation:
   * 9(x - 536) = 4(3y/4)
   * 9x - 4824 = 3y

4) Substitute into total equation:
   * x + y = 2120
   * 9x - 4824 = 3y
   * x + (9x - 4824)/3 = 2120
   * 3x + 9x - 4824 = 6360
   * 12x = 11184
   * x = 932 (initial boys)

5) Therefore:
   * Initial girls (y) = 2120 - 932 = 1188
   * Final boys = 932 - 536 = 396
   * Final girls = 1188 * 3/4 = 891
   * Difference = 891 - 396 = 495

**Answer:** 495

**Correct:** Yes (+4)

## Question s2q13

**Question Type:** open_ended_with_multiple_parts

**Reasoning:**
Let's solve this step by step:

1) First, let's find how much paint was transferred from A to B:
   * Total paint = 7.35 litres
   * Initially, Bottle A had 1/5 of total = 7.35 × (1/5) = 1.47 litres
   * All of this 1.47 litres was transferred to Bottle B

2) For finding initial amount in Bottle C:
   * After transfers, we know that:
     - Bottle A has twice the paint in Bottle B
     - Bottle B has twice the paint in Bottle C
   * Let's say Bottle C has x litres
     Then Bottle B has 2x litres
     And Bottle A has 4x litres
   * Total paint = 7.35 = 4x + 2x + x = 7x
   * Therefore, x = 7.35/7 = 1.05 litres
   * This is the final amount in Bottle C
   * To get initial amount, subtract what was transferred from B:
     Initial C = 1.05 - (1/5 of what was in B after first transfer)
     = 1.05 - (1/5 × 1.47) = 1.05 - 0.294 = 0.756 litres

**Answer:** ['1.47 litres', '0.756 litres']

**Correct:** No

## Question s2q14

**Question Type:** open_ended_with_multiple_parts

**Reasoning:**
Let me solve this step by step:

(a) For the 6th win:
- 1st win: 3 points
- 2nd win: 3 + 2 = 5 points
- 3rd win: 5 + 2 = 7 points
- 4th win: 7 + 2 = 9 points
- 5th win: 9 + 2 = 11 points
- 6th win: 11 + 2 = 13 points
So, Gary will score 13 points for his 6th win.

(b) Let's find the pattern:
- Each win increases by 2 points more than the previous win
- The sequence is: 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, ...
- To find total points after n wins, we need to sum this sequence
- This is an arithmetic sequence with first term a₁=3 and common difference d=2
- Using arithmetic sequence sum formula: Sₙ = n(a₁ + aₙ)/2, where aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)d
- 98 = n(3 + [3 + (n-1)2])/2
- 98 = n(6 + 2n - 2)/2
- 196 = n(2n + 4)
- 196 = 2n² + 4n
- 2n² + 4n - 196 = 0
- n² + 2n - 98 = 0
- Using quadratic formula: n = 7
Therefore, Gary needs to win 7 times in a row to achieve 98 points.

**Answer:** ['13 points', '7 wins']

**Correct:** Yes (+2), No

## Question s2q15

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
Let's solve this step by step:

1) Given that the circle has a diameter of 24 cm:
   - Radius (r) = 12 cm
   - Area of full circle = πr² = 3.14 × 12² = 452.16 cm²

2) The quadrant represents 1/4 of a circle, so:
   - Area of quadrant = (πr²)/4 = 452.16/4 = 113.04 cm²

3) Looking at the figure:
   - The shaded area consists of the quadrant minus the overlapping region with the circle
   - Due to symmetry, there are two identical shaded regions
   - Each shaded region is 1/12 of the circle's area (as the quadrant is divided into three equal parts)

4) Therefore:
   - Area of one shaded region = (πr²)/12
   - Total shaded area = 2 × (πr²)/12 = (πr²)/6
   - Total shaded area = 452.16/6 = 75.36 cm²


**Answer:** 75.36

**Correct:** No

## Question s2q16

**Question Type:** open_ended_with_multiple_parts

**Reasoning:**
Let me solve this step by step:

1) Let's say number of shirts = x
   Then number of shoes = 4x (since 4 times as many shoes were sold)

2) Let's say price of each shoe = p
   Then price of each shirt = p + 15

3) Total money from shoes = 4x × p
   Total money from shirts = x × (p + 15)
   Total money = $6120
   Difference in money from shoes and shirts = $3240

4) We can write:
   4xp - x(p + 15) = 3240
   4xp - xp - 15x = 3240
   3xp - 15x = 3240
   x(3p - 15) = 3240

5) Also: 4xp + x(p + 15) = 6120
   4xp + xp + 15x = 6120
   5xp + 15x = 6120
   x(5p + 15) = 6120

6) From equations in steps 4 and 5:
   x = 20 shirts
   p = $65 per shoe

7) Therefore:
   Money from shoes = 4 × 20 × $65 = $4680
   Number of shirts = 20

**Answer:** ['$4680', '20']

**Correct:** Yes (+2), No

## Question s2q17

**Question Type:** open_ended_with_multiple_parts

**Reasoning:**
Let me solve this step by step:

Part (a):
1. Initially, each person had 1/4 of the total money
2. Abu gave 2/3 of his money to Bob
3. So Abu kept 1/3 of his original share
4. Therefore, Abu's final fraction = 1/4 × 1/3 = 1/12 of the total money

Part (b):
1. Let's say the initial sum was x
2. Initially each person had x/4
3. After Abu gave 2/3 of his money to Bob:
   - Abu had: x/4 × 1/3 = x/12
   - Bob had: x/4 + (2/3 × x/4) = x/4 + 2x/12 = 5x/12
   - Cheryl had: x/4
   - Donna had: x/4
4. After Bob gave 1/5 of his money to Cheryl:
   - Bob had: 5x/12 × 4/5 = 20x/60 = x/3
   - Cheryl had: x/4 + (5x/12 × 1/5) = 3x/12 + x/12 = x/3
5. After Cheryl gave 3/8 of her money plus $55 to Donna:
   - Cheryl had: x/3 × 5/8
   - Donna had: x/4 + (x/3 × 3/8) + 55 = 595
6. Using Donna's final amount: x/4 + (x/3 × 3/8) + 55 = 595
7. Solving this equation: x = 1080

**Answer:** ['1/12', '$1080']

**Correct:** Yes (+1), No
