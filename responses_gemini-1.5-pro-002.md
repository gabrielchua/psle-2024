**Question Type:** multiple_choice

**Reasoning:**
7 809 621 = 7 000 000 + ______ + 9000 + 600 + 20 + 1
Let the missing number be x.
7 809 621 = 7 000 000 + x + 9000 + 600 + 20 + 1
7 809 621 = 7 000 000 + x + 9621
7 809 621 - 7 000 000 - 9621 = x

## Question s1q07

**Question Type:** multiple_choice

**Reasoning:**
Let S be the sum of the 5 numbers. Since the average of the 5 numbers is 14, we have S/5 = 14, so S = 5 * 14 = 70. Let x be the 6th number. When the 6th number is added, the sum becomes S + x, and the average of the 6 numbers is 14. Therefore, (S + x)/6 = 14, so S + x = 6 * 14 = 84. Since S = 70, we have 70 + x = 84, which implies x = 84 - 70 = 14. Thus, the 6th number is 14.

**Answer:** 14

**Choice:** 2

**Correct:** Yes (+1)

## Question s1q09

**Question Type:** multiple_choice

**Reasoning:**
The total number of tickets sold is 860.
The number of tourist tickets sold is 353.
The number of student tickets sold is 120.
The number of Singaporean tickets sold can be calculated using the pie chart. Since the pie chart is a circle, the total degrees is 360 degrees. The angle for senior citizen is 90 degrees. The sum of angles occupied by tourists, students and singaporeans is 360 - 90 = 270 degrees.
The angle for Singaporeans is 270 * 1/3 = 90 degrees, and the number of Singaporean tickets is (90/360) * 860 = (1/4) * 860 = 215
The number of senior citizen tickets sold is:
860 - 353 - 120 - 215 = 172
Final Answer: The final answer is $

## Question s1q12

**Question Type:** multiple_choice

**Reasoning:**
Let r be the radius of the quarter circles. The width of the rectangle is 2r and the height is r. 
Since the height of the rectangle is 10cm, r = 10cm. 
The perimeter of the shaded part = 2 * (1/4 * 2 * pi * r) = pi * r
Given pi = 3.14 and r = 10, the perimeter is 3.14 * 10 = 31.4 cm.

**Answer:** 31.4 cm

**Choice:** 1

**Correct:** No (Correct option is #3)

## Question s1q15

**Question Type:** multiple_choice

**Reasoning:**
Let the total amount of money Lisa have be M. Lisa spent 20% of her money on a blouse, which is 0.2M. The rest of the money is (1 - 0.2)M = 0.8M. Lisa used the rest of the money to buy a skirt and a bracelet. The skirt cost $24 more than the blouse, which is 0.2M + $24. The bracelet cost $72. The total cost of the skirt and bracelet is 0.8M = (0.2M + $24) + $72. 0.8M = 0.2M + $96. 0.8M - 0.2M = $96 0.6M = $96 M = $96 / 0.6 = $160. The cost of the blouse is 0.2M = 0.2 * $160 = $32. The cost of the skirt is $32 + $24 = $56. Lisa bought a skirt, blouse, and bracelet. There is no information on the bag, so the cost of the bag is unknown. However, since Lisa spent all her money, Lisa has no money to buy the bag. Therefore, the cost of the bag is $0.

**Answer:** $0. However, there is no information about the bag. So, the bag must be something Lisa already owns, which she didn't spend any more money on. So, the closest answer to $0 within the options is $16. Therefore, $16 is a likely answer. 

**Choice:** 1

**Correct:** Yes (+2)
