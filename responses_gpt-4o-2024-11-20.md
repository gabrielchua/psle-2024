## Question s1q15

**Question Type:** multiple_choice

**Reasoning:**
Let the total amount of money Lisa had be $x$. She spent 20% of her money on a blouse, so the cost of the blouse is 0.2x. The remaining money is 0.8x, which she used to buy a skirt and a bracelet. The bracelet cost $72, so the cost of the skirt is 0.8x - 72. The problem states that the skirt cost $24 more than the blouse, so we can write the equation:

0.8x - 72 = 0.2x + 24.

Simplify the equation:

0.8x - 0.2x = 72 + 24,
0.6x = 96,
x = 96 / 0.6,
x = 160.

Thus, the total amount of money Lisa had was $160. The cost of the blouse is 0.2 * 160 = $32. The cost of the skirt is 0.8 * 160 - 72 = $56. The bracelet cost $72. The cost of the blouse is $32, which matches choice (4).

## Question s1q22

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
We are given that ABCD is a square, AB = EB, and ∠BAE = 65°. To find ∠BCE, we can use the following reasoning:

1. Since ABCD is a square, all angles of the square are 90°, and all sides are equal.
2. Triangle ABE is isosceles because AB = EB. Therefore, the base angles of triangle ABE are equal. Let the base angles be x.
3. The sum of angles in triangle ABE is 180°. Thus, we have:
   ∠BAE + x + x = 180°
   65° + 2x = 180°
   2x = 115°
   x = 57.5°
   Therefore, ∠ABE = 57.5°.
4. Since ∠ABC is 90° (a property of the square), we can find ∠BCE as:
   ∠BCE = ∠ABC - ∠ABE
   ∠BCE = 90° - 57.5°
   ∠BCE = 32.5°.

**Answer:** 32.5°

**Correct:** No

## Question s1q28

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
To maximize the number of women in the queue while ensuring there are at least 3 men between any two women, we can arrange the queue such that each woman is followed by at least 3 men. This means that for every woman, there are 3 men accompanying her in the sequence. Let the number of women be W and the number of men be M. The total number of people is given as 115, so W + M = 115. Additionally, since there are at least 3 men between any two women, the number of men must be at least 3 times the number of women minus 3 (for the last group of men). This gives the inequality M ≥ 3W - 3. Solving these equations and inequalities, we find the maximum number of women that satisfies these conditions.

## Question s1q29

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
Let the number of pencils in each box at first be x. Since there are 5 boxes, the total number of pencils initially is 5x.

Sandra took 21 pencils from each box, so the total number of pencils removed is 5 × 21 = 105. The number of pencils left in each box is x - 21, and the total number of pencils left in the 5 boxes is 5(x - 21).

According to the problem, the total number of pencils left in the 5 boxes is equal to the total number of pencils in 2 boxes at first. This gives the equation:

5(x - 21) = 2x

Expanding and simplifying:
5x - 105 = 2x
5x - 2x = 105
3x = 105
x = 35

Thus, the number of pencils in each box at first was 35.

**Answer:** 35

## Question s2q01

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
We are given two equations based on the problem:
1. 3s + 5d = 360
2. 6s + 15d = 900

From the second equation, we can simplify by dividing through by 3:
2s + 5d = 300

Now, subtract the first equation from this simplified equation:
(2s + 5d) - (3s + 5d) = 300 - 360
-s = -60
s = 60

The cost of one stool is $60. Substitute s = 60 into the first equation:
3(60) + 5d = 360
180 + 5d = 360
5d = 180
d = 36

The cost of one desk is $36. Rounding to the nearest $10, the cost of one desk is $40.

## Question s2q03

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
In a rhombus, the diagonals bisect each other at right angles. Therefore, the triangle formed by the diagonals is a right triangle. \n\nGiven that \u2220BAC = 52\u00b0, \u2220x is the complementary angle in the right triangle \u2206ABC. Thus, \u2220x = 90\u00b0 - 52\u00b0 = 38\u00b0.\n\nSince the diagonals of a rhombus bisect the angles of the rhombus, \u2220y is equal to \u2220BAC. Therefore, \u2220y = 52\u00b0.\n\nThe sum of \u2220x and \u2220y is \u2220x + \u2220y = 38\u00b0 + 52\u00b0 = 90\u00b0.

## Question s2q09

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
Initially, there were 45 soccer balls, 30 basketballs, and 68 netballs, totaling 143 balls. After 80 balls were added, the total became 223 balls. The problem states that the number of soccer balls increased by 40%, so the new number of soccer balls is 45 + 0.4(45) = 63. Similarly, the number of netballs increased by 25%, so the new number of netballs is 68 + 0.25(68) = 85. The remaining balls must be basketballs. Initially, there were 30 basketballs, and the new total is 223 - (63 + 85) = 75 basketballs. The percentage increase in basketballs is calculated as ((75 - 30) / 30) * 100 = 150%.

## Question s2q10

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
To solve this problem, we first calculate the time Tammy took to travel 20 km at 30 km/h. Using the formula time = distance/speed, Tammy's time is 20/30 = 2/3 hours (or 40 minutes). Adam reached the park 15 minutes later than Tammy, so his travel time is 40 + 15 = 55 minutes, which is 55/60 = 11/12 hours. Adam's speed is 42 km/h, so the distance he traveled is given by distance = speed × time. Substituting the values, Adam's distance is 42 × (11/12) = 38.5 km.

**Answer:** 38.5 km

## Question s2q11

**Question Type:** open_ended_with_multiple_parts

**Reasoning:**
To solve the problem, we use the properties of parallelograms, trapeziums, and straight angles. 

(a) To find ∠BCD, note that BCDE is a trapezium with BE || CD. Since ∠ADF = 42° and DF is a straight line, ∠CDF = 180° - 42° = 138°. Since BE || CD, ∠BCD = ∠CDF = 138° (alternate angles).

(b) To find ∠ABE, note that ABEF is a parallelogram, so opposite angles are equal. ∠DAF = 68°, and ∠ABE = ∠DAF = 68°.

(c) To find ∠BEF, note that in parallelogram ABEF, adjacent angles are supplementary. Thus, ∠BEF = 180° - ∠ABE = 180° - 68° = 112°.

**Answer:** ['138°', '68°', '112°']

**Correct:** No

## Question s2q12

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
Let the number of boys initially be B and the number of girls be G. From the problem, we know that B + G = 2120. After 536 boys leave, the remaining boys are B - 536. Similarly, after 1/4 of the girls leave, the remaining girls are G - (1/4)G = (3/4)G. The ratio of boys to girls becomes 4:9, so we can write:

(B - 536) / ((3/4)G) = 4 / 9.

From this equation, we can solve for B and G. Substituting B = 2120 - G into the equation and solving gives the values of B and G. Finally, we calculate the difference between the remaining girls and boys.

**Answer:** 720

**Correct:** No

## Question s2q13

**Question Type:** open_ended_with_multiple_parts

**Reasoning:**
Let the initial amounts of paint in Bottles A, B, and C be A, B, and C liters, respectively. From the problem, we know:

1. A + B + C = 7.35 liters.
2. \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the paint in Bottle A is transferred to Bottle B. After this transfer, the amount in Bottle A becomes \( \frac{4}{5}A \), and the amount in Bottle B becomes \( B + \frac{1}{5}A \).
3. \( \frac{1}{5} \) of the paint in Bottle B is transferred to Bottle C. After this transfer, the amount in Bottle B becomes \( \frac{4}{5}(B + \frac{1}{5}A) \), and the amount in Bottle C becomes \( C + \frac{1}{5}(B + \frac{1}{5}A) \).
4. After these transfers, Bottle A has twice the amount of paint in Bottle B, and Bottle B has twice the amount of paint in Bottle C:
   - \( \frac{4}{5}A = 2 \times \frac{4}{5}(B + \frac{1}{5}A) \).
   - \( \frac{4}{5}(B + \frac{1}{5}A) = 2 \times (C + \frac{1}{5}(B + \frac{1}{5}A)) \).

Using these equations, we solve for A, B, and C step by step.

**Answer:** ['1.47 liters', '1.05 liters']

**Correct:** No

## Question s2q14

**Question Type:** open_ended_with_multiple_parts

**Reasoning:**
The problem involves an arithmetic progression where the first term (a) is 3, and the common difference (d) is 2. 

(a) To find the score for the 6th win, we use the formula for the nth term of an arithmetic sequence: \( a_n = a + (n-1)d \). Substituting \( a = 3 \), \( d = 2 \), and \( n = 6 \), we calculate \( a_6 = 3 + (6-1) \times 2 = 3 + 10 = 13 \). Thus, the score for the 6th win is 13.

(b) To find the number of wins required to achieve a total of 98 points, we use the formula for the sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence: \( S_n = \frac{n}{2} (2a + (n-1)d) \). Substituting \( S_n = 98 \), \( a = 3 \), and \( d = 2 \), we solve \( 98 = \frac{n}{2} (2 \times 3 + (n-1) \times 2) \). Simplifying, \( 98 = \frac{n}{2} (6 + 2n - 2) \), which becomes \( 98 = \frac{n}{2} (2n + 4) \), or \( 98 = n(n + 2) \). Solving \( n^2 + 2n - 98 = 0 \) using the quadratic formula, \( n = \frac{-2 \pm \sqrt{2^2 - 4(1)(-98)}}{2(1)} \), we find \( n = 7 \) (ignoring the negative root). Thus, Gary must win 7 times to achieve 98 points.

**Answer:** ['13', '7']

**Correct:** Yes (+2), No

## Question s2q15

**Question Type:** open_ended

**Reasoning:**
The shaded area is the difference between the area of the quadrant and the area of the semicircle. The diameter of the circle is given as 24 cm, so the radius is 12 cm. The area of the semicircle is half the area of a full circle, which is (1/2)πr². The area of the quadrant is one-fourth the area of a full circle, which is (1/4)πr². Subtracting the semicircle's area from the quadrant's area gives the shaded area.

**Answer:** 56.52 cm²

**Correct:** No

## Question s2q16

**Question Type:** open_ended_with_multiple_parts

**Reasoning:**
To solve part (a), we know that Mr. Chan received $3240 more for the shoes than the shirts. Let the amount received for the shirts be $x. Then, the amount received for the shoes is $x + $3240. The total amount received is $6120, so we can write the equation:

x + (x + 3240) = 6120.

Solving this equation gives the amount received for the shoes.

For part (b), let the number of shirts sold be y and the number of shoes sold be 4y (since 4 times as many shoes were sold). Let the price of each shoe be $p and the price of each shirt be $p + $15. The total revenue from shirts is y(p + 15), and the total revenue from shoes is 4y(p). Using the amounts calculated in part (a), we can solve for y.

**Answer:** ['$4680', '36']

**Correct:** Yes (+2), No

## Question s2q17

**Question Type:** open_ended_with_multiple_parts

**Reasoning:**
(a) Abu initially had 1/4 of the total money since the sum was shared equally among four people. He gave 2/3 of his money to Bob, leaving him with 1/3 of his initial share. Therefore, the fraction of the total money Abu had in the end is (1/3) × (1/4) = 1/12.

(b) Let the total sum of money be $x. Each person initially had x/4. Abu gave 2/3 of his share to Bob, so Bob's new amount became x/4 + (2/3)(x/4). Bob then gave 1/5 of his money to Cheryl. Cheryl's new amount became x/4 + (1/5)(Bob's money). Cheryl then gave 3/8 of her money and $55 to Donna. Donna ended up with $595. Using these relationships, we can solve for x.

**Answer:** ['1/12', '$2400']

**Correct:** Yes (+1), No
